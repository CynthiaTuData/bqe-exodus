# Mapping Displacement in Brooklyn's Red Hook during the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway's constrcution

 
*Read the story here: [The BQE Exodus](https://xinyitu.github.io/the-bqe-exodus/)*
## Goal
The construction of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway in NYC started in 1937. The "crown jewel" of the designs that Robert Moses' proposed, the BQE forced thousands of residents in the neighboods that the BQE cut through in the 1940s and 1950s. Among them was Red Hook, a waterfront community in South Brooklyn, where the demographic was mostly immigrants and African Americans. 

This project seeks to digitally recreate the communities that were demolished during this period.
## Data Collection
- The main source for archival images of demolished buildings and streets include: New York Public Library, Brooklyn Public Library via [OldNYC.org](https://www.oldnyc.org/#true)* and [UrbanArchive.org](https://www.urbanarchive.org/cities/nyc)*.
- Facts about the demolition and displacement were mostly based on articles published in the New York Times in the 1940s.
- Sanborn fire insurance map (1939 ver. and 1950 ver.) were used to match the archival photos with the lots where they once stood.

## Methodlogy & Analysis
#### Challenge:
The project invloves a lot of research and diving into the city's archive. It is very difficult to identify exactly where the archival photos were taken decades ago. Luckily the description of some archive photos include some information about the streets where the buildings were located, and I was able to identify some by cross-referencing old insurance maps and Google Maps.  

The project also includes a scrolly-telly section to showcase the images side by side with the old map. Figuring out how to make the scrolly effect show up properly took a fairly huge amount of time in the production process.
